Sales trends analysis for e-commerce company

# Company Background

Founded at the end of 2018, E-List provides customers around the world with high-tech electronics and accessories. With a wealth of order, customer, and geographic data, E-List is now prioritizing analysis to uncover valuable insights. These insights will be pivotal in identifying opportunities for improvement and providing actionable next steps to support growth in a competitive landscape.

# Overview

From 2019 - 2022 over 108K orders were placed, generating $28.1M in sales. Across these 4 years, sales and order count are up 28%. Not to be overlooked is E-List's meteoric sales boom in 2020 (163%). A signficant portion of this rise can be attributed to the paradigm shift in customer behavior, to order online, observed during the start of the pandemic. However beginning in 2022, the trend in sales, average order value (aov) and order count has taken a sharp dive. Hence, the battle lies in finding ways to maintain the value captured during 2020 and 2021, which should outline our path to longer-term growth.

## Loyaty Program

The loyalty program seems to serve as another viable avenue to maintain some of the value captured in 2020's boom. After it's rollout in 2019, significant customer adoption did not occur until the beginning of 2021. Sales and order count from loyalty customers exceeded that of non-loyalty customers in 2021. This trend has continued through 2022 with the AOV of loyalty customers now also exceeding that of non-loyalty customers.

Looking into our marketing efforts and how it translates to loyalty program signups:

- The direct marketing channel has the highest number of loyalty participants: 23.5K signups (40% signup rate)
- The email marketing channel has the highest average signup rate: 59% signup rate (~8K signups)

Doing a deeper assessment of the loyalty program to breakdown what consumers are using or seeming to enjoy the most will provide clarity on ways to grow this program in a manner aligned with DotDash's customers.
