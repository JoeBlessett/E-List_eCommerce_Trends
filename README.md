# Company Bockground

Founded at the end of 2018, DotDash provides customers around the world with high-tech electronics and accessories. With a wealth of order, customer, and geographic data, DotDash is now prioritizing analysis to uncover valuable insights. These insights will be pivotal in identifying opportunities for improvement and providing actionable next steps to support growth in a competitive landscape.

# Overview

From 2019 - 2022 over 108K orders were placed, generating $28.1M in sales. Across these 4 years, sales and order count are up 28%. Not to be overlooked is E-List's meteoric sales boom in 2020 (163%). A signficant portion of this rise can be attributed to the paradigm shift in customer behavior, to order online, observed during the start of the pandemic. However beginning in 2022, the trend in sales, average order value (aov) and order count has taken a sharp dive. Hence, the battle lies in finding ways to maintain the value captured during 2020 and 2021, which should outline our path to longer-term growth.
