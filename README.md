Sales trends analysis for e-commerce company

# Company Background

Founded at the end of 2018, E-List provides customers around the world with high-tech electronics and accessories. With a wealth of order, customer, and geographic data, E-List is now prioritizing analysis to uncover valuable insights. These insights will be pivotal in identifying opportunities for improvement and providing actionable next steps to support growth in a competitive landscape.

# Overview

From 2019 - 2022 over 108K orders were placed, generating $28.1M in sales. Across these 4 years, sales and order count are up 28%. Not to be overlooked is E-List's meteoric sales boom in 2020 (163%). A signficant portion of this rise can be attributed to the paradigm shift in customer behavior, to order online, observed during the start of the pandemic. However beginning in 2022, the trend in sales, average order value (aov) and order count has taken a sharp dive. Hence, the battle lies in finding ways to maintain the value captured during 2020 and 2021, which should outline our path to longer-term growth.

## Sales Trends

### Yearly:

2019 being EList first full fiscal year that provided a baseline for the company standard and benchmarks. 2020 and 2021 would be seen as slightly outliers years with a global pandemic that would result in a boom in our sales. 2020 being the year that brought in the highest total sales at $10 Million and an average order value of $300. 2021 brought in slightly similar numbers with a $9 Million year in sales with a $255 average order value, but a 40% increase in order volume from the previous year; going from a 33K order count to 35K. 2022 would be seen as a return to normalacy with sales being $4.9 Million, $230 average order value, and 21K order count. 

Elist has seen an overall increase of 28% of sales growth when comparing 2022 to 2019 numbers while not only maintaining the average order value at $230, but also increasing the order count by the same amount. This shows an growth in customer audience year over year.

### Seasonal:

Q3 is objectively the strongest performing quarter across all metrics in a Year Over Year analysis for it's consistency of strong order amounts and sales. Quarters 1 and 4 have changed back-and-forth throughout the years. Q4 tends to have a strong order amount every year but it is not consistently the top in sales in any demographic or region. A question that would need to be asked is, are we wanting to focus on getting the performing quarters optimal or focus on the negative consistentcies of Q2? Q1 is successful from the holiday season and where we see the better numbers for sale and order count from non-loyalty customers (see Seasonal section detail for more details).

## Loyalty Program

The loyalty program seems to serve as another viable avenue to maintain some of the value captured in 2020's boom. After it's rollout in 2019, significant customer adoption did not occur until the beginning of 2021. Sales and order count from loyalty customers exceeded that of non-loyalty customers in 2021. This trend has continued through 2022 with the AOV of loyalty customers now also exceeding that of non-loyalty customers.

Looking into our marketing efforts and how it translates to loyalty program signups:

- The direct marketing channel has the highest number of loyalty participants: 23.5K signups (40% signup rate)
- The email marketing channel has the highest average signup rate: 59% signup rate (~8K signups)

Doing a deeper assessment of the loyalty program to breakdown what consumers are using or seeming to enjoy the most will provide clarity on ways to grow this program in a manner aligned with DotDash's customers.
